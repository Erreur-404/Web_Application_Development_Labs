# Overview

This repository contains my labs from the Web Applications Development and Conception course I took at Polytechnique Montr√©al. The labs followed an incremential structure where each lab upgraded the preceding one by adding a new technology or by moving to one that is more efficient.

These labs were completed in collaboration with [Mo-LK](https://github.com/Mo-LK).
